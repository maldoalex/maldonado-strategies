            <h3 class="card-title">Leadership Background</h3>
            <p class="card-body">Turning challenges into successes, Diana is an extraordinary Austin political and public figure and leads with grace and
            compassion through each of her volunteer and professional roles. Over the years, her success comes from listening to
            people’s needs and finding solutions in the process of building thriving communities</p>
            <p class="card-body">As the first Latina elected to represent Williamson County in the House of Representatives, she advocated for
                education,
                business, and safe communities. In this role, she authored/co-authored 88 bills and was named “Freshman of the Year”
                by
                her colleagues. Through her collaboration with key stakeholders, she secured nearly $16 million for education, $10
                million for road expansion, and additional funds for renewable energy initiatives and walking trails in parks. She
                served as Secretary for the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, Defense & Veterans Affairs, and coveted State
                Affairs
                committees.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Recent Accomplishments</h3>
            <p class="card-body">From her six years on the Round Rock ISD Board of Trustees and as president, Maldonado oversaw a successful $349 million
            bond election while improving academic outcomes and goals. During her time as a Financial Advisor for one of the world’s
            largest investment firms, she enjoyed guiding individuals through financial planning strategies with an emphasis on
            women & wealth initiatives.</p>
            <p class="card-body">Maldonado recently led as the President & CEO at the Greater Austin Hispanic Chamber of Commerce where she
                successfully
                led membership engagement, strategic policy initiatives and revenue diversification efforts. She managed the
                challenges
                that the Covid-19 pandemic presented to small businesses and expanded advocacy and legislative efforts during a
                historic
                moment for Latinos in their advancement and representation as the largest demographic in the United States, as of
                mid-2021.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Unwavering Character</h3>
            <p class="card-body">Diana's lived experience as a single parent, while completing her undergrad and working full time, then onto public
            office, helped turn obstacles into challenges while building support networks through various stages of her career. In
            turn, she built an expansive network on influential leaders and friends.</p>
            <p class="card-body">After losing her re-election bid in 2010, Diana turned, yet another obstacle into a win and took to the outdoors. She
                enjoys travel and includes destination marathons in places like Paris, New York, Berlin, Boston and the Sahara
                desert in
                Morocco! Her interest in reading has led her to a deeper level of understanding and compassion regarding local and
                global perspectives, but especially loves her time with her two-year-old granddaughter.</p>
